# Crypto-Voting

Crypto voting is a decentralized application for a setting up a vote on a topic.
Implemented on the Ethereum Rinkeby Test Network.

## Problems

-   Ideally voting should be free in my opinion
-   Max number of votes per choice is 2^24 - 1 = 16777215
-   Max number of votes per user is 2^8 - 1 = 255
